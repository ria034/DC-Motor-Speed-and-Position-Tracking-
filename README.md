# DC-Motor-Speed-and-Position-Tracking-
Designed and implemented a closed-loop control system to track the speed and position of a DC motor using feedback from an encoder. Developed real-time controllers in embedded C/Python to achieve accurate motion control for robotics and mechatronics applications.
